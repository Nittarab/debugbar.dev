## Question

When you are setting up your MySQL you need to create new users. Using the command line you can do it easily.

## Answer


First create your database if it's not done yet.Â Then create your mysql user.

```sql
create database mynewdb;
```

What you need to replace:

* **mynewdb** : the name of the database
* **some_table** : the name of the table
* **localhost** : the host of your database, in my case everything is on the same server
* **user1** : the name of your mysql user
* **@s3cur3PWD** : the password of your user

### A user who can access all tables in a given database

```sql
grant all privileges on mynewdb.* to 'user1'@'localhost' identified by "@s3cur3PWD";
```

### A user who can access all databases

```sql
grant all privileges on *.* to 'user1'@'localhost' identified by "@s3cur3PWD";
```

### A user who can access a given table in a given database

```sql
grant all privileges on mynewdb.some_table to 'user1'@'localhost' identified by "@s3cur3PWD";
```
