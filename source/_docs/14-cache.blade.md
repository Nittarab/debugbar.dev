If you use `Rails.cache`, you will see the calls in the list here.

For example, the following code will show 3 entries with the same transaction id. One read, cache is not found, so we generate the value and then write it.

```ruby
Rails.cache.fetch "nb_total_posts" do
  Post.count
end
```

{!! $page->screenshot('cache', "Screenshot of cache in the debugbar") !!}
