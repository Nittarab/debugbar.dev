## Running the debugbar in production or staging

One of the next feature I want to add is how to run the debugbar in production or staging. 
It should be ignored for all request not coming from authorized users. If ignored, there should be no performance impact.

Running the debugbar in production will let you explore your application with real data!

Running the debugbar in staging can be useful if you have a frontend SPA and a backend API. The staging is the backend and you only run the frontend locally.

**This feature is not ready yet, but it will come.**
